# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue
Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)
On the sales person page navigate to a specific sales person. Once there add the script provided to the url and go to the new link. You can now see all of the territories that this company services.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation
Open up the website in two different browsers. Log into one of the sites and make sure you are logged out on the other browser. Open up the session changing website provided. Copy the session ID from the site that you are logged in on and paste it in the Session ID update in the browser you are not logged in on. Navigate back to the site on both browsers. You should now be logged in on both. 

## Green
Vulnerability #1: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
For this exploit, I used the comments section to post some script. To view the script exploit, I then had to log in, navigate to the feedback section of the site, and the script ran automatically.  

Vulnerability #2: Username Enumeration
You can find this by attempting to log into the site. If you use the provided username and a fake password (I used '1234') you will get the following BOLD phrase: "Login was unsuccessful". If you modify the username slightly by deleting a character or two, you will get the same phrase except it is no longer bolded. 

## Red
Vulnerability #1:  Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
While you are logged in, take note of the IDs of Salespeople that were fired for stealing/not public until Sept. Log out and go to the Find a Salesperson tab. Click on one of the available sales representatives. In the URL, change the ID to one of the noted IDs from earlier. You now have access to info that you shouldn't be able to access. 

Vulnerability #2:  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Edit the CSRF token to one of the forms. Even with the changed token, you should still be able to submit the form.
